# Flying Car Simulation

A simulation and control project for a rectangular prism vehicle with four thrusters capable of pitch and roll control.

## Description

This project models a "flying car" - a rigid body with four thrusters positioned at the corners. The vehicle can be controlled to achieve desired pitch and roll orientations through differential thrust.
